## Introduction

- In economics, a production function relates the physical output of a production process to physical inputs or factors of production.
- It is a mathematical function that relates the amount of output that can be obtained from a given number of inputs.
- The production function could be expressed in a general form such as $Q=f(x_1, x_2, \cdot, x_n)$, where $Q$ denotes the output of the firm, and $x_1, x_2, \cdots, x_n$ are the values of inputs.
- Apart from production function, another important concept in economics is the economic cost. 
- If a firm is producing output $Q$ based on $n$ inputs $x_1, x_2, \cdots, x_n$, where the prices of inputs are $r_1, r_2, \cdots, r_n$ then the total cost of the firm is given by:

  $$C=r_1x_1+r_2x_2+\cdots +r_nx_n$$

 **Example**:
 Cobb-Douglass production function, Constant Elasticity of Substitution production function, Linear production function, etc.

### Why production functions?

- The production function is the central part of productiontheory, and there is theoretical interest in its estimates.
- Economists are often involved in describing activity at the level of a firm, an industry, or the economy as a whole through the production function approach
- he production function also gives information about increasing or decreasing returns to scale and the marginal products of labor and capital.


## Problem Statement

- A most familiar empirical production function found out by statistical methods is the Cobb-Douglas production function.
- When there are two inputs $K$ and $L$, the Cobb-Douglass production function has the form: $Q=AL^{\alpha}K^{\beta}$,  with $Q$ as the  output, $L$ as the quantity of labour employed, $K$ as the quantity of capital employed, and $A, \alpha$ and $\beta$ are positive constants.
- In its general form, where more than two inputs are needed  

$$Q=A \prod_{i=1}^n L_{i}^{\alpha_i}, \quad L=\left(L_1, L_2, \cdots,  L_n\right)$$

- In this final year project, we consider  a firm that buys four inputs $K, L, R$, and $M$, for its production output $Q$ over a period of 12 months.
- The set data representing these variables is available. The Cobb-Douglass production of this firm is given by:

$$Q(K,L,R,M) = AK^{\alpha}L^{\beta}R^{\gamma}M^{\eta}$$

- Assuming that the firm has the amount $C$, which maybe used to buy the four inputs, it follows that we must have the equality $r_1K+r_2L+r_3R+r_4M=C$.
- Using the estimated parameters $\hat{\alpha}, \hat{\beta}, \hat{\gamma}, \hat{\eta}$,  the second problem considered is to optimize the production under this constraint of available cost. Mathematically, we consider the problem:

$$
\begin{array}{ccc}
\text{Optimize} & Q(K,L,R,M) = A K^{\hat{\alpha}} L^{\hat{\beta}} R^{\hat{\gamma}} M^{\hat{\eta}} \\
\text{Subject to} & r_1 K + r_2 L + r_3 R + r_4 M = C.
\end{array}
$$

- Given the amount  $Q_0$ of the production of that a firm want to get, and the price of each unit of the outputs $K,L,R,M$ and the available amount of money $C$, we want to determine an optimal combination of these inputs:

  $$
\begin{array}{ccc}
\text{Optimize} & Q(K,L,R,M) = A K^{\hat{\alpha}} L^{\hat{\beta}} R^{\hat{\gamma}} M^{\hat{\eta}} \\
\text{Subject to} & r_1 K + r_2 L + r_3 R + r_4 M = C.
\end{array}
$$

Mathematically, the problem to solve is the following:

$$
\begin{array}{ccc}
\text{Optimize} & r_1K + r_2L + r_3R + r_4M = C \\
\text{Subject to} & A K^{\hat{\alpha}} L^{\hat{\beta}} R^{\hat{\gamma}} M^{\hat{\eta}} = Q_0.
\end{array}
$$

- The problems are solved by using the method of Lagrange multiplies.


## Objectives

- **Primary Objective**: o optimize the output from the generalized Cobb-Douglass production function in a given company where more than two inputs are available
while accounting for cost linear constraints satisfied by those inputs.
- **Secondary Objectives**:
    - To estimate the parameters of the generalized Cobb-Douglass production function in a firm with more than two inputs.
    - To determine how much output to produce from the Cobb-Douglas production function for a given amount of inputs.
    - To know the maximum output from the Cobb-Douglass production function, and what combination of inputs to be used given the price of inputs.
 
**Example of a Cobb-Douglass production function**:

- Here's an example of a production function: $Q = K^{0.3} \cdot L^{0.7}$.
- Here, $Q$ represents the total output, $K$ represents the amount of capital used in production, and $L$ represents the amount of labor used in production. 
- The exponents $0.3$ and $0.7$ represent the elasticity of output with respect to capital and labor, respectively.
- If we have $10$ units of capital and $20$ units of labor, we can calculate the total output as follows:
  
$$Q =  10^{0.3} \cdot 20^{0.7}=16.245$$


## Results

### Estimating the parameters in the Cobb-Douglass production function

- We consider a firm which uses the Cobb-Douglass production functions with four inputs $K,L,M$ and $N$.
- The production $Q$ and the units of inputs used over a period of 12 months are presented in the following table.

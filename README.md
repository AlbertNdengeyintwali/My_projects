## Introduction

- In economics, a production function relates the physical output of a production process to physical inputs or factors of production.
- It is a mathematical function that relates the amount of output that can be obtained from a given number of inputs.
- The production function could be expressed in a general form such as $Q=f(x_1, x_2, \cdot, x_n)$, where $Q$ denotes the output of the firm, and $x_1, x_2, \cdots, x_n$ are the values of inputs.
- Apart from production function, another important concept in economics is the economic cost. 
- If a firm is producing output $Q$ based on $n$ inputs $x_1, x_2, \cdots, x_n$, where the prices of inputs are $r_1, r_2, \cdots, r_n$ then the total cost of the firm is given by $$C=r_1x_1+r_2x_2+\cdots +r_nx_n$$

 **Example**:
 Cobb-Douglass production function, Constant Elasticity of Substitution production function, Linear production function, etc.

### Why production functions?

- The production function is the central part of productiontheory, and there is theoretical interest in its estimates.
- Economists are often involved in describing activity at the level of a firm, an industry, or the economy as a whole through the production function approach
- he production function also gives information about increasing or decreasing returns to scale and the marginal products of labor and capital.


## Problem Statement

- A most familiar empirical production function found out by statistical methods is the Cobb-Douglas production function.
- When there are two inputs $K$ and $L$, the Cobb-Douglass production function has the form: $Q=AL^{\alpha}K^{\beta}$,  with $Q$ as the  output, $L$ as the quantity of labour employed, $K$ as the quantity of capital employed, and $A, \alpha$ and $\beta$ are positive constants.
- In its general form, where more than two inputs are needed  
\begin{equation}
Q=A \prod_{i=1}^n L_{i}^{\alpha_i}, \quad L=\left(L_1, L_2, \cdots,  L_n\right)
\end{equation}
- In this final year project, we consider  a firm that buys four inputs $K, L, R$, and $M$, for its production output $Q$ over a period of 12 months.
- The set data representing these variables is available. The Cobb-Douglass production of this firm is given by:
 $Q(K,L,R,M) = AK^{\alpha}L^{\beta}R^{\gamma}M^{\eta}$

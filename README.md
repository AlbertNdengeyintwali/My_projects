# Art Gallery Problem

This is a Beamer presentation on the Art Gallery Problem, a famous problem in computational geometry. The goal of the problem is to determine the minimum number of guards required to cover an art gallery with a polygonal shape. The guards are placed in such a way that they can view the entire gallery.

## Introduction

The "Art Gallery Theorem" originated from a real-world situation. The theorem proposes that if a polygon has a certain number of sides, you can determine the minimal number of guards required to cover the entire gallery (polygon). The challenge is to compute this minimum number and identify the optimal placement of the guards.

### Key Definitions:
- A **polygon** is defined as an ordered sequence of at least three points, called vertices, connected by line segments. A polygon in the plane is formed by connecting vertices in a specific order.

## Problem Statement

Given a polygonal art gallery \(P\), the problem is to determine:
- How many minimum guards are needed to cover the entire polygon?
- Where to place the guards to ensure the whole gallery is covered?

In this case, we will focus on a 24-sided polygon as an example for calculation.

## Methodology

The tools and steps necessary to solve this problem include:

1. **Define the Parameters**: Set up the necessary parameters for the polygon and guards.
2. **Use Geometry Software**: Employ geometry software to model the polygon.
3. **Draw the Polygon**: Create the visual representation of the polygon.
4. **Customize the Shape**: Adapt the polygon to fit specific conditions of the problem.
5. **Visualize and Analyze**: Analyze the placement and number of guards required.
6. **Documentation**: Document the results and methodology for future reference.

## Discussion

The Art Gallery Problem is essential in various fields, including:
- **Security**: Ensuring proper surveillance in environments with polygonal shapes.
- **Robotics**: Determining efficient movement and positioning of robots within polygonal spaces.
- **Computer Vision**: Applying the theory in spatial analysis and optimization.

By solving this problem, we not only optimize guard placement but also contribute to fields that deal with polygonal environments, such as security and robotics.
